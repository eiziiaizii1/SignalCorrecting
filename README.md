# SignalCorrecting
(1st term, Programming-1 course assignment)

Correct the signals according according to specific rules

Welcome to the unlimited possibilities of the multiverse reality. You are sent to a verse in which
programmers never are in a need of conditional statements (no if-switch statements, or ternary
operations are allowed). What is more, Java language is now having no built-in classes except the
Object, Scanner and System classes (for instance: no Math class has been written). Only the
primitive data types are allowed (int, double, char, boolean, ..etc.).
Thus, the task given to you must be accomplished without using conditional clauses or additional
built-in classes.


What the task says: An alien spaceship broadcasts a frequency of digital signals that can be
converted into 0-1 digits (always a 8 digit combination). In brief, a stream of digits entered via the
console is supposed to be caught. It is obvious that the digits we acquire can be converted into
base ten - decimal. The situation here is the noise which interferes with the original signal that we
are listening to. Signal noise, which negates the last item of the stream, may appear in the very
first character of your input stream. All of the characters must be either 0 or 1, otherwise it is a
noise. Every first character is always 0. The input stream will be taken as a single set of numeric
characters.

→ an input stream with noise is: 21001000
→ corrected and clean version is: 01001001

  Your supervisors will be much obliged if you can make it happen in that universe and of
course by using their coding paradigms (No built-in class (any like String and Math classes’)
operations and conditional statements are allowed).
  Now, it is time for you to go back to our universe, and solve the same problem without
having any of those restrictions. Use String class and conditional statements and compare both
solutions.
